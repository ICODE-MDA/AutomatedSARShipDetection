3. The matrix library was written by Robert Davies.  At the time of download the site was located at http://www.robertnz.net. He gives free use in commercial and non commercial as long as his code remains in tact and the credits for the author are known.

4. The kbool library does polygon boolean operation and is used by the ossimPolyArea2d class.  The license terms are based on the wxwidgets licensing which gives free use in commercial and non-commercial libraries.  At the time of download the module used could be found at: http://boolean.klaasholwerda.nl/download/download.html

5. Geotrans.  The geotrans library is a set of map projections that are certified and hosted by NGA.  They give free use in commercial and non commercial software packages and at the time of download the geotrans modules could be found at http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/geotrans/.  We have embedded the datum, ellipsoid, and map projections into the ossim baseline and wrapped in C++ classes so to remove the global variable access common in the raw getorans c library.

6. KAKADU:  This OSSIM plugin utilizes the kakadu library for compression/
decompression.  Users must adhere to kakadu licensing.
