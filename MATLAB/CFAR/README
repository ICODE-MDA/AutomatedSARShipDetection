This file describes all the information necessary to run the CFAR algorithm within MATLAB.
The implementation takes any image file as input. MATLAB has the ability to process geotiffs
but to ensure that everyone can run the code I have left all the additional toolboxes out 
such as the GEOS.

Requirements: 
1. MATLAB. 
	Tested on MATLAB 2012a.
2. Image Processing Toolbox
	Requires MATLABS image processing toolbox to open image files.
3. MEX compilation
	The program requires that C++ MATLAB/Mex files can be compiled on the system running the code. 


Running instructions 
1. To run the entire program run the file called "runCFAR.m"
   a) The program includes an example png file that is a small section of a SAR image.
      The input into the system can be changed by changing the file on line 11
      namely: image = imread('vessels.png');
   b) The various attributes of the "paramStruct" variable.
      This parameter structure allows the user to specify the size of the
	i) Guard Window Length
	ii) Background Window Length
	iii) CFAR Thresholding value
	iv) Pad size (number of pixels around the edge to skip).

2. The system displays the result via MATLAB's native image viewer but can be adapted to 
   allow for the writing of images (imwrite) the result.
