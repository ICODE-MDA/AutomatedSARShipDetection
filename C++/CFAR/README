This file describes all the information necessary to run the CFAR algorithm within OSSIM on ASAR ENVISAT N1 files in C++. 

Requirements: 
1. OSSIM. 
	If you have an 64 bit system then the compiled libraries and h-files included in the 'lib' folder should allow the program to work as is.
2. OpenCV
	The makefile includes OpenCV files using pkg-config so if you intend to use the makefile
	ensure you have pkg-config set up for OpenCV (see http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/ 
	for more details about pkg-config)
3. GDAL (optional). 
	If you would like to remove land areas (shape files) or georeference the ASAR image use GDAL executables
	(see the note at the bottom).


Running instructions 
1. To compile the drive file run (using makefile):
	a) "make" to create the dependancy file (deps.mak). IGNORE ERRORS ON THIS FIRST MAKE. 
	b) "make" again to create the driver executable.
2. Running info:
	There are five main arguments that can be passed to the system
	a) "-fi" <filenameAndPath> --> the input file name of the ENVISAT N1 file
	b) "-fo" <filenameAndPath> --> the output file name of the CFAR processed N1 file
	c) "-g" <size> --> the length of the square guard window. Must be unequal and less than the background window length. Default: 5
	d) "-b" <size> --> the length of the square background window. Must be unequal and greater than guard window length Default: 7
	e) "-t" <decimal threshold> --> the threshold value T used in the CFAR algorithm. Default: 2.5

3. To run:
	a) Using makefile: make ARGS="-fi filepath.N1 -fo filepathResult.tiff -g 9 -b 11 -t 2.1" run
	b) using executable: ./driver -fi filepath.N1 -fo filepathResult.tiff -g 9 -b 11 -t 2.1
		

Until N1 georeferencing is fixed (or in the likely case *I* have done something wrong and still need to figure out what) I recommend using the 3 commands to georefernce (gdal_translate), warp (gdal_warp) and remove land areas (gdal_rasterize) from the N1 processed files.
